# Payment Gateway Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

We have successfully integrated multiple Vietnamese payment gateways into the Audio Tai Loc backend system. The implementation provides a unified interface for handling payments across different providers.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Payment Gateway Interface
- Created `IPaymentGateway` interface defining standard methods for all payment providers
- Implemented `BasePaymentGateway` abstract class with common functionality
- Defined standard result types: `CreatePaymentResult`, `PaymentStatusResult`, `RefundResult`

### 2. ✅ Payment Gateway Implementations

### 3. ✅ Payment Gateway Factory
- **File**: `src/payments/payment-gateway.factory.ts`
- Centralized gateway selection based on payment method
- Dynamic availability checking
- Support for all payment methods including Cash on Delivery

### 4. ✅ Unified API Controller
- **File**: `src/payments/payment-gateway.controller.ts`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/payments/gateways/available` - List available gateways
  - `POST /api/payments/create/:orderId` - Create payment
  - `POST /api/payments/webhook/:method` - Handle webhooks
  - `GET /api/payments/status/:transactionId` - Check status
  - `POST /api/payments/refund/:transactionId` - Process refund
  - `GET /api/payments/order/:orderId/payments` - List order payments

### 5. ✅ Database Updates
- Added `ZALOPAY` to PaymentMethod enum in Prisma schema
- All payment gateways save transaction data to the payments table
- Gateway responses stored as JSON for audit trail

### 6. ✅ Environment Configuration
Updated `.env.example` with all required gateway credentials:
```env
# VNPay
VNPAY_TMN_CODE=your-vnpay-terminal-code
VNPAY_HASH_SECRET=your-vnpay-hash-secret
VNPAY_URL=https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html
VNPAY_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/return
VNPAY_API_URL=https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/merchant_webapi/api/transaction

# MoMo
MOMO_PARTNER_CODE=your-momo-partner-code
MOMO_ACCESS_KEY=your-momo-access-key
MOMO_SECRET_KEY=your-momo-secret-key
MOMO_API_ENDPOINT=https://test-payment.momo.vn
MOMO_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:3000/payment/return
MOMO_NOTIFY_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook/momo

# ZaloPay
ZALOPAY_APP_ID=your-zalopay-app-id
ZALOPAY_KEY1=your-zalopay-key1
ZALOPAY_KEY2=your-zalopay-key2
ZALOPAY_ENDPOINT=https://sb-openapi.zalopay.vn/v2/create
ZALOPAY_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook/zalopay
```

## Testing Guide

### 1. Local Testing with Ngrok
```bash
# Start backend server
npm run start:dev

# In another terminal, expose local server
ngrok http 3001

# Update webhook URLs in payment gateway dashboards with ngrok URL
```

### 2. Test Payment Creation
```bash
# Create payment with VNPay
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payments/create/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "VNPAY"}'

# Create payment with MoMo
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payments/create/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "MOMO"}'
```

### 3. Simulate Webhooks
```bash
# For VNPay
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook/VNPAY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vnp_Amount": "100000000",
    "vnp_BankCode": "NCB",
    "vnp_ResponseCode": "00",
    "vnp_TxnRef": "ATL000001",
    "vnp_SecureHash": "your-hash"
  }'
```

### 4. Check Payment Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payments/status/ATL000001?method=VNPAY \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Signature Verification**: All webhooks are verified using HMAC signatures
2. **HTTPS Required**: Use HTTPS for all webhook URLs in production
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit real credentials to version control
4. **Idempotency**: Webhook handlers are idempotent to handle duplicate notifications
5. **Logging**: All payment transactions are logged for audit purposes

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Obtain Production Credentials**:
   - Register merchant accounts with each payment provider
   - Complete KYC verification
   - Get production API credentials

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Replace sandbox URLs with production URLs
   - Update all credentials to production values

3. **Testing**:
   - Conduct end-to-end testing with real payments
   - Test edge cases (timeouts, failures, refunds)
   - Load test webhook endpoints

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for payment failures
   - Monitor webhook processing times
   - Track payment success rates by gateway

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guides for each payment method
   - Document error codes and troubleshooting steps
   - Create integration guides for frontend team

## Frontend Integration

The frontend needs to:

1. **Payment Method Selection**:
   - Call `/api/payments/gateways/available` to get available methods
   - Display payment options to users

2. **Payment Creation**:
   - Call `/api/payments/create/:orderId` with selected method
   - Redirect user to `paymentUrl` returned in response

3. **Return URL Handling**:
   - Handle return from payment gateway
   - Check payment status and show appropriate message

4. **Order Status Updates**:
   - Poll or use websockets to get real-time payment status
   - Update UI when payment is confirmed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Payment Creation Fails
- Check credentials in environment variables
- Verify order exists and has valid amount
- Check gateway service availability

### Webhook Not Received
- Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible
- Check firewall/security group settings
- Review payment gateway webhook configuration

### Invalid Signature Error
- Ensure correct keys are used for each environment
- Check for trailing/leading spaces in credentials
- Verify webhook data is not modified by proxy/middleware

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check gateway-specific documentation
2. Review error logs in application
3. Contact payment gateway support for merchant issues
4. Check webhook logs in payment gateway dashboards
